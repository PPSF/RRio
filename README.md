# R/Git[hub] Workshop
## 28 September - 3 October 2015

## Abstract

In this workshop, we will cover basics needed to start participants on using R and Git for analysis of and collaboration on biological data.  R is a piece of open source statistical software, which allows users to perform standard as well as customized statistical analyses.  Git is a piece of software for version control, allowing users to document changes made to R code and revert to old versions if necessary.  Using Git, users may also share and collaborate on code via the website GitHub.

Topics covered will include:

* Data import and export to and from R
* Organizing and formatting data for use in analyses
* Performing basic analyses on data sets
* Visualizing data using different types of plots
* Writing functions to perform tasks that are repeated multiple times

The workshop will include teaching sessions as well as interactive sessions in which participants may practice applying methods to their own data or to sample datasets.  Thus, it would be beneficial for participants to bring data they are currently analyzing.

As a prerequisite for the workshop, all participants should create a GitHub profile (github.com) if needed, and install Git on their computers.  This will allow us to immediately start sharing course notes at the start of the workshop.  Furthermore, all participants should install the most recent versions of R and RStudio on their computers if needed.
